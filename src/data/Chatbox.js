    question:"What has been the timeline of \"Golden ratio\"?",
    answer:`The uses date to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks.\n
    The Fibonacci Series was discovered around 1200 AD.\n
    The “Divine Proportion” in the 1500’s.\n
     The “Golden Ratio” was coined in the 1800’s and the symbol ("phi") in the 20th century.`

    question:"Why is the \"Golden ratio\" used in designing?",
    answer:"Ancient Greek architecture used the Golden Ratio to determine pleasing dimensional relationships between the width of a building and its height, the size of the portico and even the position of the columns supporting the structure. The final result is a building that feels entirely in proportion."

  {
    question:"Who first discovered the golden ratio?",
    answer:"Phidias (500 BC – 432 BC), a Greek sculptor and mathematician, studied phi and applied it to the design of sculptures for the Parthenon"

    question:"Tell a random fact about it!",
    answer:["Even the microscopic realm is not immune to Fibonacci. The DNA molecule measures 34 angstroms long by 21 angstroms wide for each full cycle of its double helix spiral. These numbers, 34 and 21, are numbers in the Fibonacci series, and their ratio 1.6190476 closely approximates Phi, 1.6180339.","The number of petals in a flower consistently follows the Fibonacci sequence. Phi appears in petals on account of the ideal packing arrangement as selected by Darwinian processes; each petal is placed at 0.618034 per turn (out of a 360° circle) allowing for the best possible exposure to sunlight and other factors.","The unique properties of the Golden Rectangle provides another example. This shape, a rectangle in which the ratio of the sides a/b is equal to the golden mean (phi), can result in a nesting process that can be repeated into infinity — and which takes on the form of a spiral. It's call the logarithmic spiral, and it abounds in nature.","phi has surprising connections with continued fractions and the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers."]
